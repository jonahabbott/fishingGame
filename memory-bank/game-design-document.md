# Game Design Document: Hook & Havoc (Core Concept)

## 1. Game Concept

* **Genre:** 2D Fishing Adventure Sandbox
* **Platform:** Web Browser
* **Elevator Pitch:** Explore a mysterious, procedurally generated world where your fishing rod is everything. Catch fish for food, haul up materials for crafting, battle strange creatures pulled from the depths, build your base, and uncover secrets hidden beneath the waves. Think *Terraria* meets *Stardew Valley*, but with a fishing rod instead of a pickaxe.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

1.  **Explore:** Navigate diverse, watery biomes (islands, caves, depths) using platforming and swimming.
2.  **Fish:** Cast your line to gather resources (fish, junk, treasure) and hook enemies. Master the reeling mini-game.
3.  **Craft & Build:** Use gathered materials at workbenches to create better rods, specialized bait, survival gear, and expand your waterside base.
4.  **Fight:** Use specialized fishing rods and crafted bait tactically to defeat hostile aquatic life and biome guardians (bosses).
5.  **Progress:** Defeat bosses to unlock new biomes, recipes, and abilities, pushing deeper into the world's mysteries.

## 3. Key Mechanics

* **Fishing-Centric Interaction:** The fishing rod is the primary tool for resource gathering, combat initiation (hooking enemies), and interacting with specific environmental objects.
* **Rod & Bait System:** Different rods offer unique combat styles (melee swings, ranged pulls, utility effects). Bait provides tactical advantages (explosions, lures, buffs, debuffs).
* **Procedural World:** A new world layout with varied biomes, secrets, and challenges generated each playthrough, encouraging exploration and replayability.
* **Crafting & Base Building:** Simple, resource-driven crafting system. Players build and upgrade a small, functional base ("The Shanty") with essential stations and storage.

## 4. Player Goal

* Survive and thrive in the world by mastering the fishing mechanics.
* Explore all biomes, uncover hidden lore, and catalogue discoveries.
* Defeat all major biome guardians.
* Build and customize a functional base.
* Craft the ultimate fishing gear.

## 5. Target Audience

* Players who enjoy sandbox survival/crafting games (like *Terraria*, *Minecraft*, *Don't Starve*).
* Fans of fishing mini-games and collection mechanics.
* Players looking for a unique twist on the adventure genre.
