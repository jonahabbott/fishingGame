# Implementation Progress

## 2023-12-19: Project Setup (Step 1.1)

### Completed

- Initialized project structure with the following:
  - Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
  - Configured Vite for development and building (vite.config.ts)
  - Created package.json with project dependencies
  - Installed Phaser 3 as the game framework
  - Set up Jest for unit testing
  - Created initial directory structure:
    - `/src/assets/`: For game assets
    - `/src/scenes/`: For Phaser scene classes
    - `/src/gameobjects/`: For game object classes
    - `/src/systems/`: For game systems and managers
    - `/src/utils/`: For utility functions
    - `/src/data/`: For game data and configuration
  
- Created minimal viable skeleton:
  - Created main entry point (src/main.ts)
  - Set up basic initial scene (src/scenes/GameplayScene.ts)
  - Configured Phaser with:
    - Arcade physics
    - Correct scaling for responsive gameplay
    - PixelArt rendering mode

- Added basic validation:
  - Created a unit test for GameplayScene
  - Confirmed test passes
  - Visual validation with blue background and on-screen text

### Next Steps

- Step 1.2: Add basic asset loading
- Step 1.3: Create player sprite and implement basic movement
